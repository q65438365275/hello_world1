hello_world1 20181217 Public
README.md contents added
Second change to the README.md 20181217 11:33AM (why there is NO explicit SAVE button)?
Because "Commit changes" is NOT visible! You have to SCROLL all way DOWN!!! 
Why the button could NOT be put above??? (this line DELETED in branch2)
(in branch2) (new line)
