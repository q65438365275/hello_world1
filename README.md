hello_world1 20181217 Public
README.md contents added
Second change to the README.md 20181217 11:33AM (why there is NO explicit SAVE button)?
Because "Commit changes" is NOT visible! You have to SCROLL all way DOWN!!! 
Why the button could NOT be put above???
Since  we are in Branch1, this line  SHOULD NOT be visible in the MAIN branch???
Yes, confirmed. 
How to show next line as a next line (default is a next tab)? Clikced to "No Wrap", committed.
1870361 = id of the initial commit
eb381dc = example of id of each next commit
Check that the commit message is optional (this one goes with commit message)
